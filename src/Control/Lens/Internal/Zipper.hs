-- Every 'Zipper' starts with 'Top'.
--
-- /e.g./ @'Top' ':>' a@ is the type of the trivial 'Zipper'.
data Top

infixl 9 :>

-- | This is the type of a 'Zipper'. It visually resembles a \"breadcrumb trail\" as
-- used in website navigation. Each breadcrumb in the trail represents a level you
-- can move up to.
--
-- This type operator associates to the left, so you can use a type like
--
-- @'Top' ':>' ('String','Double') ':>' 'String' ':>' 'Char'@
--
-- to represent a zipper from @('String','Double')@ down to 'Char' that has an intermediate
-- crumb for the 'String' containing the 'Char'.
--
-- You can construct a zipper into *any* data structure with 'zipper'.
--
-- You can repackage up the contents of a zipper with 'rezip'.

--
-- The combinators in this module provide lot of things you can do to the zipper while you
-- have it open.
--
-- Note that a value of type @h ':>' s ':>' a@ doesn't actually contain a value
-- of type @h ':>' s@ -- as we descend into a level, the previous level is
-- unpacked and stored in 'Coil' form. Only one value of type @_ ':>' _@ exists
-- at any particular time for any particular 'Zipper'.
