[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekmett/lens.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ekmett/lens)

This package provides lenses and lens families. These lenses are compatible with those from lens-family, lens-family-core, lens-family-th
and from polylens, but provide a number of combinators that those don't, and are easier to import and use.
